# unsupervised-MNIST
EMNIST was my visual learning project, which was an extension of the MNIST
project, not only containing digits but also letters. This project aimed to simulate a variational
autoencoder (VAE) model and compared its result with human cognition. Convolution neural
network (CNN) is regarded as one of the best deep learning approaches for image
classification. The reason for CNN being good for image recognition since it not only contains
multiple convolution filters to scan and complete effective dimensionality reduction to suit a huge
number of parameters in an image, but also it can perform feature extraction automatically.
The best CNN architecture was going to be found in this project and tried other different
supervised learning models with different parameters to analyze the dataset and found a model
that can perform the best classification. Then, comparing the accuracy between CNN and the
best tested supervised learning model to confirm CNN was one of the best supervised
approaches for image classification. The CNN model was going to be compared with the VAE
model.
